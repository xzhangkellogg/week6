Hello!  This is Joe, Alex, and sometimes Bilal.  If you stay here we will be your hosts while here in Chicago. 

We are highly rated hosts not because we have a 5 star luxury property, but because we just about always deliver on what we offer.  The best value in Chicago at this price point doing mostly shared, dorm-style accommodations.  


Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you dont and just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.  

All of our listings include desks, gigabit internet to share, a full array of breakfast items including bacon, eggs, milk, orange juice, coffee, cereal, tea, oatmeal, at least 2x of fruit, 2x of vegi, cheese, home made bread and jam, and we also take requests for other items that you may enjoy like yogurt, almond milk, or other vegis and fruits we dont already have.  We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 8 years and absolutely love it.    This is our full time profession but we also dabble in mystery shopping as well as online sales and stained glass.  

We love Airbnb, Chicago, and our guests.   If privacy and being in downtown are not important to you, you'll be hard pressed to find a better Airbnb experience in Chicago at this price point and if you do, we'll probably price match =)

We all look forwarding to meeting those of you who book with us!",within an hour,100%,92%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West Ridge,16,16,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'kba', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual', 'work_email']",t,t,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",West Ridge,,42.01653,-87.68788,Shared room in apartment,Shared room,2,,2 shared baths,1,1,"[""Smoke alarm"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Hot water"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Cleaning before checkout"", ""Washer"", ""Shampoo"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Oven"", ""Stove"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Essentials"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Game console"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Heating"", ""Free street parking"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dryer"", ""TV"", ""Air conditioning"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Hangers"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Backyard"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""First aid kit"", ""Breakfast"", ""Host greets you"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Iron""]",$121.00,1,900,2,2,900,900,2.0,900.0,,t,30,60,90,180,2021-04-20,139,0,0,2012-11-23,2020-02-03,93,9,9,10,10,9,9,R17000015667,f,18,1,5,12,1.36

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.

Lois and Eduardo
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hi there!  We're Lois and Eduardo! She's from Kansas, I'm from Argentina, we met in Spain, and now we live in Chicago!  (¡Hablamos español, por supuesto!)  We've been Chicagoans for over 35 years, love the city, and love our home. Our kids Evan and Gina, our kids-in-law Lindsey and Mark, and our gorgeous grandkids, Enzo and Uma, are around often, and our Labradoodle, Leo, is a sweetie. (He is hypo-allergenic, doesn't shed, and loves people.)

You will note that our kitchen is the focal point of our daily lives, both for conversation and for enjoying Eduardo's delicious, Italian-inspired home cooking.  You might say that our philosophy of life is to work hard, play hard, and enjoy the people around us all the time. One of our favorite things has always been to host our diverse friends and family in our home - sometimes for a day, sometimes for a year.  Now, with AirBnB, we're making it official!  We're happy to say our home feels like an urban oasis and we look forward to hosting you!

I'm a ""people-person"" from a family of world travelers; 4th generation Chicago cityboy with experience working in museums, hotels and ecolodges around the globe. 
Chicago history, architecture, and preservation are big interests of mine, and I take great pride in caring for the historic properties my family has lived in, owned & maintained for decades. 

I love AirBnb.  We have traveled, backpacked, hiked, camped, hoteled moteled, couch-surfed and home-shared... But AirBnb has been the single best thing to happen to us in our adult lives.

When we travel, we turn to AirBnb first, whether internationally, nationally, and in our own hometown.  From the glitzy new city experience to weekend trip to some small town in the country, we prefer staying with those in the AirBnb community.  The experience is always unique and always more authentic.

We are AirBnb hosts and consider it central to our lives here in Chicago.  Because my family lives in Chicago, one of us is always in the city, often while the rest of us travel. Any repairs are handled immediately. A while back, when I was moving from the building we own, we decided to open it for AirBnB guests. Now we have progressed to having vacation rentals within the building where we live.  Living nearby with my partner Alyssa allows us to keep in great touch with our guests, maintaining the gardens and accommodations ourselves, as well as hosting occasional art, music and dining events. 

I love this way of traveling and hosting; meeting the folks who come to stay with us is precisely what fuels me on the day-to-day, and it's what makes our vacations so much more enjoyable!  We've met hundreds of incredible people and stayed in fantastic homes across the world.

We are highly rated hosts not because we have a 5 star luxury property, but because we just about always deliver on what we offer.  The best value in Chicago at this price point doing mostly shared, dorm-style accommodations.  


Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you dont and just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.  

All of our listings include desks, gigabit internet to share, a full array of breakfast items including bacon, eggs, milk, orange juice, coffee, cereal, tea, oatmeal, at least 2x of fruit, 2x of vegi, cheese, home made bread and jam, and we also take requests for other items that you may enjoy like yogurt, almond milk, or other vegis and fruits we dont already have.  We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 8 years and absolutely love it.    This is our full time profession but we also dabble in mystery shopping as well as online sales and stained glass.  

We love Airbnb, Chicago, and our guests.   If privacy and being in downtown are not important to you, you'll be hard pressed to find a better Airbnb experience in Chicago at this price point and if you do, we'll probably price match =)

We all look forwarding to meeting those of you who book with us!",within an hour,100%,92%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2907254/profile_pic/1432872933/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West Ridge,16,16,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'kba', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual', 'work_email']",t,t,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",West Ridge,,42.01653,-87.68788,Shared room in apartment,Shared room,1,,2 shared baths,1,1,"[""Dishes and silverware"", ""Washer"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Iron"", ""Hair dryer"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Heating"", ""Hangers"", ""Host greets you"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Essentials"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Microwave"", ""First aid kit"", ""TV"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Hot water"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Free street parking"", ""Breakfast"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Stove"", ""Bed linens"", ""Backyard"", ""Oven"", ""Shampoo"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Game console"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Cleaning before checkout"", ""Dryer"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Kitchen"", ""Wifi""]",$31.00,1,900,2,2,900,900,2.0,900.0,,t,30,60,90,179,2021-04-22,160,8,1,2013-08-04,2021-03-23,91,10,9,9,10,9,9,R17000015667,t,18,1,5,12,1.70

When this happens, our ad was taken down and not able to be booked by other people.  it's the same as the ad not even existing.  The guest shows up, gets denied entry due to this, and then wants a refund for their mistake and we have no opportunity to rebook.

But here I am, 20 something years later, running a fabulous Greek vacation rental business with historic homes & penthouses in Athens, planning Greek travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: End of November 2017 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 15 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece ask us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so we're finally doing it - we've just completed the renovation of a fab old factory with 3 vacation rentals called the Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether we share an ouzo in Athens in our Acropolis View Alpha Plus penthouse or Sky Villa or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago, in our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed.

Airbnb is extremely fun for us since we are also international.  We have traveled to most of the states in the US, London, Milan,  Italy, Turkey. I have also attended Universities on both sides of the Atlantic (London and Chicago). 

Favorite music are Reggae, R&B, hip hop, Latin music, country music. I love to eat and my favorite food are fish, fruits, and vegetables. My favorite sports are rock climbing, archery, diving, soccer, and basketball.

So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read a bit about myself. I will start out by saying that to me there's nothing like a good conversation. I love talking about geography, different cultures and even finances. 

My true passion is hosting. I would love to dedicate to it full time sooner rather than later. After having studied abroad for 3 years, more than taking myself around the world, I want to show Puerto Rico and Chicago to the world. If you're curious, I was born and raised in paradise: Puerto Rico!

I know how much guests value when a host personally welcomes them, however due to work and being between Puerto Rico and Chicago, unfortunately I'm not available to greet each guest personally. Regardless, I can guarantee that all my places will make you feel like at home. I have put a lot of effort and love into getting them setup. Each one of our listings (""our"" because my mom is the big helper) has been available for hosting after both my mom and I have stayed at each one and have approved them. We will say we are quite into the details; if you are too, I'm sure you'll notice.  

About me, I can't live without traveling, those deep conversations that by the end have made you question yourself and of course I most definitely can't live without Pancho! Pancho is my son (well, my dog) whom I just spoil too much. I rescued him from the streets of Puerto Rico and ever since we have been partners in crime. 

FOOD! Almost forgot about that one. Can't live without it! I love trying new dishes so if I'm around and you feel like cooking and exchanging recipes, let's do it! 

I love hosting guests that have positive vibes, are relaxed and know how to make the most out of every moment.

My favorite two board games are Mancala and Rummikub so if you think you can take a challenge, I'm more than willing to play! ;-)
